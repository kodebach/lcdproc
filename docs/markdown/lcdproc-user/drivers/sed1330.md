# The sed1330 Driver

This section talks about using LCDproc with graphical LCD displays
driven by the EPSON/SMOS SED1330 or SED1335 LCD controllers, which may
also be known by their new names: S1D13300 (= SED1330) and S1D13305 (=
SED1335).

The displays are driven in text mode using their built-in character
generator and the graphic mode for bars and the heartbeat icon (a
bouncing ball).

## Connections

> **Warning**
> 
> Displays using SED1330/1335 chipset come in a variety of pin-outs and
> power configurations. They usually require negative voltage for
> contrast and some displays have a negative voltage generator onboard.
> 
> Connections below are for the G242C, G121C and G321D displays. Always
> consult documentation about the specific display before assuming the
> connections given here are also correct for your
display\!

ConnectionType `bitshaker` ordered by LPT port pins

The potentiometer should be connected like this on these display
modules:

``` 

    === GND
     |
    .-.
    | |
    | |5k
    '-'
     |
     |
    .-.10k potentiometer
    | |
    | |<----------------o V0
    | |
    '-'
     |
     O Vlc (= -24V)
```

The G242C generates -24V internally. It is available on Vlc.

To generate -24 from the +5V without an external power source, you can
use the following circuit.

```

## Keypad

The sed1330 driver supports the same direct keys and matrix keypad
connections as the hd44780 driver. See
[???](#hd44780-connections-keypad).

## Configuration in LCDd.conf

### \[sed1330\]

  - CellSize = PARAMETERS.SIZE  
    Specify the size of a character in pixels. WIDTH may vary between
    `6` and `8`; legal values for HEIGHT range from `7` to `16`. If not
    given CellSize defaults to `6x10`.
    
    Contrary to other drivers the character size of an LCD using the
    sed1330 driver is not given directly. Instead it is determined by
    the pixel size of the display, which is derived from the display
    type setting and the character cell size specified with this
    setting.

  - ConnectionType = { *`classic`* | `bitshaker` }  
    Select the type of the wiring, see
    [Connections](#sed1330-connections).
    
    If not given, it defaults to `classic`.

  - Port = `PORT`  
    Specify the address of the parallel port the LCD is connected to.
    Common values for PORT are `0x278`, `0x378` and `0x3BC`. If not
    given, it defaults to `0x278`.

  - Type = { `G321D` | `G121C` | `G242C` | `G191D` | `G2446` |
    `SP14Q002` | `HG25504` }  
    Type of LCD module. Besides other things (internal setup) this
    configuration setting determines the size of the display in pixels.
    
    | Type       | Size (in pixels) |
    | ---------- | ---------------- |
    | `G321D`    | 320 x 200        |
    | `G121C`    | 128 x 128        |
    | `G242C`    | 240 x 128        |
    | `G191D`    | 192 x 192        |
    | `G2446`    | 240 x 64         |
    | `SP14Q002` | 320 x 240        |
    | `HG25504`  | 320 x 240        |
    

    > **Note**
    > 
    > Currently the G321D and SP14Q002 are the only ones that this
    > driver is tested with.
