# The i2500vfd Driver

This section talks about using LCDproc with an Intra2net Intranator 2500
VFD display. The displays are part of a custom high grade steel chassis
and not sold separately. More information can be found here: [Intra2net
AG](http://www.intra2net.com/)

It connects to USB using a FTDI FT245BM chip and therefore needs libftdi
as requirement. libftdi can be found here:

## Features

The display features a 140x32 pixel Noritake VFD tube which gets driven
by an Atmel ATmega128 processor and used as a 23x4 character display
with a 6x8 pixel font. It features B/W colors and two additional
adjustable grayscale colors. It does hardware double buffering with up
to 27 FPS and shows an animated boot logo until data is received from
USB.

## Options
