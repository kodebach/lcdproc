# The G15 Driver

This section talks about using LCDproc with LCD displays on Logitech G15
gaming keyboards.

## Features

This driver uses g15daemon's virtual screen capabilities to enable
multiple LCDd instances to display on the LCD of the Logitech G15 gaming
keyboard. Text and other rendering services are provided by libg15render
from the g15tools project. Input is provided by g15daemon, enabling use
of the L1-L5 and G1 keys. The required libraries are available from the
g15daemon and g15tools projects at sourceforge.net.

## Configuration in LCDd.conf

Currently there aren't really any configuration options to be set. The
width and height are hardcoded based on the font currently used. In the
future, now that libg15render has FreeType2 support, there may be
options to adjust the font used and the display size.
